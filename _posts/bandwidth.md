## Understanding Bandwidth

Bandwidth is the data that gets passed to a viewer when they watch a video.
So, every time someone presses play on your videos, data gets passed from our
servers to their browsers, which is counted as bandwidth.

But just pressing play isn't the only way to use bandwidth. Other things count
toward your monthly bandwidth usage too--like the player and thumbnail image
loading, the video being loaded and played as your own internal views,
and the video being downloaded.

## How It All Works

When you upload a video to Wistia we create multiple derivatives to ensure the
smoothest playback. We want your video to play in as many environments as
possible--which is why we create not only HD files, but SD and Flash derivatives
too.

When your excited viewer presses play on your video inline (usually 640px -
960px wide), it is a waste of bandwidth to show them the HD file. At that size,
the difference in picture is nearly imperceptible. HD files are also much *much*
larger, which means the viewer can also have that stuttering playback
experience. Major bummer!

Instead, we have chosen smart standard definition defaults (what we call *Smart Encoding*)
based on your video type (i.e. screencast, action, interview) and that is the
version that is shown.

Still confused? Have no fear, we made you a helpful video too.

## Check Your Bandwidth

All right, so you understand *what* bandwidth is, now it's time to dive into how
it works in Wistia.

We'll send you a heads up email if you're on track to go over your bandwidth for
the month, but you can always check on your usage inside of your account. Just
make sure you're logged in as the **Account Owner**.

Head into Account Settings, and select *Usage* from the sidebar. There you'll
see your bandwidth usage over the course of the month. You'll also see when it's
slated to reset, and if you're likely to go over.

Here you can check out the last three months of bandwidth--and decide if moving
up a tier is the right choice. Check out our [conversion chart](#conversion_chart)
to see the hard numbers.

Not sure? Give us [a shout](http://wistia.com/support/contact)! We'll be happy to walk you through our plans.

### Bandwidth Predictor

Want help gauging how much bandwidth your videos will use? Check out our
[Bandwidth Predictor Tool](http://wistia.com/pricing/bandwidth_predictor).

Keep in mind, while this thing is pretty sweet (if I do say so myself), it *is*
just a predictor tool. The bandwidth you end up using could be different.

## Overage Pricing

Most Wistia accounts are billed at **$0.33/GB** for overages over 200GB. High
Volume plans are a bit different. [Read about that pricing here.](http://wistia.com/pricing/highvolume)

Let's walk through a fairly standard overage bill.

If you're on the $100/mo Pro Plan, and you end up using 350GB of bandwidth for
the month, here's what your bill would look like:

- $100 for the Pro Plan
- 150GB of overage at $0.33/GB = $49.50
- This month's bill: **$149.50**

If you're on an annual plan you'll be billed monthly for any overages you incur.
You can always see your receipts in [Account Settings]({{ 'account-setup#billing_statements' | post_url }}).

## How to Cut Down Bandwidth

Constantly hitting or exceeding your bandwidth limits? That's the pits! Here's
some tips for avoiding big overage bills.

### Video Quality

One of the easiest ways to help conserve bandwidth is to change the Video Quality in
Account Settings. This is a universal change for all of your videos, everywhere
they live on the internet--in your account, on Twitter, embedded online--everywhere.

To conserve bandwidth you'll want to lower the Video Quality. You can change
this setting in Account Settings when you're logged in as the **Account Owner**.

Choose "Account" from the sidebar and scroll to the bottom of the page. The default option
for Video Quality is set to *Auto*, but knocking it down to **360p** will help to
conserve bandwidth. This change will take effect immediately, and can always be
undone at any time.

Just remember to **Save Settings**, and you're good to go!

### What about Long Videos?

When someone starts watching your video, we'll begin loading the *entire* video
asset to ensure smooth playback. Let's say the viewer, under a sufficiently fast
internet connection, were to press pause or stop watching after only a few
minutes of an hour long video. It's possible that the entire derivative would
have been loaded within those first couple of minutes--using up your bandwidth.

If you've got a lot of long videos, but some
[low engagement]({{ '/audience-engagement-graph' | post_url }}), it'll help to
alleviate your bandwidth usage by breaking them up into smaller videos.

From there you can use our [Embed Links]({{ '/embed-links#simple_playlist_link_example' | post_url }})
to make an easy playlist of the videos in your series.

### Quick Tips

Here are some easy things you can do to cut down on bandwidth:

1. Minimize your own views -- your views count toward bandwidth, so try to cut
down on your own views while customizing or testing.

2. Avoid having videos set on autoplay. Once a video starts autoplaying, it will
 automatically start using bandwidth. To turn this off head into Timeline
 Actions in the [Customize panel]({{ '/customizing-your-video#timeline_actions' | post_url }}).

3. In the same vein, avoid having your videos set to loop upon finish. Looping
autoplay is a major bandwidth suck.

4. If you're not a fan of the universal [Video Quality](#video_quality) option,
you can change a single embed code to always use a lower-resolution
derivative (such as the SD derivative) to use less bandwidth. This can be done
by using the "videoQuality" [embed option]({{ '/embed-options#embed_options_list' | post_url }}).

5. Giving viewers the option to *Download* your video via the
[Social Bar]({{ '/customizing-your-video#social_bar' | post_url }}) also uses
bandwidth. You can cut down on bandwidth by removing the download button
entirely, or by changing the configuration. In the Customize panel select the
Social Bar. Next to the Download option you'll see **Configure**. Choose the SD
MP4 asset as the Download Type.

## Where Is It Coming From?

At this point, it isn't possible to gauge which video is causing a hike in
bandwidth usage if you're seeing one. But if you have a video that's getting a
lot of traffic (you can check that quickly in the [View Stream]({{ '/embedded-video-analytics#view_stream' | post_url }})), that's
probably your culprit.

You can always see the sizes of the files we're delivering from your account.
Head to any video in your account and choose **Download** from the **Video Actions**
menu. There you'll see the size of the original file, and the size of the files
Wistia has created for streaming.

## Conversion Chart

Are you exceeding your bandwidth limit on the regular? Here's a nifty chart we
put together to show you the breaking point when you should jump up to the next
plan.

Plan | Given Bandwidth | Overage | Which Plan Next?
-----|----------------|---------|------------
Basic ($25)|200GB | 845GB ($279) | Enterprise 1TB
Pro ($100) | 200GB | 606GB ($200) | Enterprise 1TB
Enterprise ($300) | 1 TB | 2,500GB ($450) | High Volume 5TB
High Volume ($750)| 5 TB | 5,000GB ($750) | High Volume 15TB
